Summary Project -- 

Chicken is the most widely kept poultry in Indonesia, this is because chicken is one of the animal proteins that is widely consumed by the public (look for evidence). Most of the chickens consumed are from chicken breeders. One of the farms can accommodate hundreds or even thousands of chickens at once (search for data). With the large number of chickens available, it is difficult to distinguish between healthy and sick chickens. Therefore, a system is needed to find out sick and healthy chickens, as well as the type of chicken disease. This study tries to identify diseases in chickens based on chicken droppings, ranging from color, texture, and size.
